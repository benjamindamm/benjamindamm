# 👋 Hi, I'm Ben – DeFi Risk Analyst & Creator of [Treno Finance](https://treno.finance)

I'm building tools that help investors, analysts, and asset managers understand risk in decentralized finance – without hype, moon-charts, or false promises.  
At [Treno Finance](https://treno.finance), we focus on transparency, risk literacy, and data-driven insights for crypto portfolios.

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🧾 **Write in-depth risk reports** for lending protocols (Aave, Compound, Morpho, etc.)  
- 🛡️ **Build a structured risk catalog** with YAML/Markdown logic – human & machine-readable  
- 📈 **Develop dashboards** with real-time metrics like liquidation exposure, stablecoin dominance, or market stress response
