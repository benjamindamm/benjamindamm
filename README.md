# 👋 Hello, I'm Ben – Engineer, Risk Analyst, Founder

I work at the intersection of software engineering, risk analytics, and financial technology. For over a decade, I’ve built complex web applications for banks, insurers, public institutions, and industry – with a clear focus on structure, maintainability, and clarity.

I'm also the founder of [Treno.Finance](https://treno.finance), a project dedicated to transparent risk assessment in decentralized finance. There, I develop tools, metrics, and dashboards that help investors understand crypto assets without relying on speculation or hype.

- **Mentoring & technical leadership**, most recently in building a design system for a Swiss online bank  
- **International projects** across industries and continents – including public sector, telecom, and industrial control systems

## 🧩 What Drives Me

I don’t believe in empty promises. I believe in well-structured software, in metrics that matter, and in risks that deserve to be named and handled – not ignored.
