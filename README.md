# 👋 Hello, I'm Ben – Engineer, Risk Analyst, Founder

I work at the intersection of software engineering, risk analytics, and financial technology. For over a decade, I’ve built complex web applications for banks, insurers, public institutions, and industry – with a clear focus on structure, maintainability, and clarity.

I'm also the founder of [Treno.Finance](https://treno.finance), a project dedicated to transparent risk assessment in decentralized finance. There, I develop tools, metrics, and dashboards that help investors understand crypto assets without relying on speculation or hype.

## 🧩 What Drives Me
