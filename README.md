# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ben â€“ Engineer & Founder

I build software with a focus on clarity, structure, and long-term maintainability.  
For more than ten years I've worked on web applications for banks, insurers, the public sector, and industry.

I'm also the founder of [Railpath](https://github.com/railpath), an open source organization for financial tools and risk frameworks. The goal: building infrastructure that belongs to everyone, not to companies or individuals.
